# MVP [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Issues-1%2B-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/XiaoleiLiuBio/MVP/issues) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-v1.0.1-blue.svg)](https://github.com/XiaoleiLiuBio/MVP/commits/master)
## A Memory-efficient, Visualization-enhanced, and Parallel-accelerated Tool For Genome-Wide Association Study
### Installation
**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU INSTALL MVP ON Microsoft R Open (https://mran.microsoft.com/download/)**<br>
**MVP** is only available on GitHub, and can be installed using **devtools**. Two packages should be installed beforehand, **snpStats** and **rfunctions** (only accepts **RcppEigen** <= "0.3.2.9.0"). **MVP** can be installed with the following R code:<br>
```r
#if "devtools" isn't installed, please "install.packages('devtools')" first.
install_version('RcppEigen', version = "0.3.2.9.0")
devtools::install_github("Bioconductor-mirror/snpStats")
devtools::install_github("jaredhuling/rfunctions")
devtools::install_github("xiaoleiLiubio/MVP")
```
After installed successfully, **MVP** can be loaded with the following R code:
```r
library(MVP)
```
Typing ```?MVP``` could get the details of all parameters.
