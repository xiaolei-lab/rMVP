## With R 3.1.0 or later, you can uncomment the following line to tell R to
## enable compilation with C++11 (where available)
##
## Also, OpenMP support in Armadillo prefers C++11 support. However, for wider
## availability of the package we do not yet enforce this here.  It is however
## recommended for client packages to set it.
##
## And with R 3.4.0, and RcppArmadillo 0.7.960.*, we turn C++11 on as OpenMP
## support within Armadillo prefers / requires it
##
## R 4.0.0 made C++11 the default, R 4.1.0 switched to C++14, R 4.3.0 to C++17
## _In general_ we should no longer need to set a standard as any recent R
## installation will do the right thing. Should you need it, uncomment it and
## set the appropriate value, possibly CXX17.

## CXX_STD = CXX11
